/**
 * <em>Chronicle</em> (in a generic sense) is a Java project focused on building a persisted low
 * latency messaging framework for high performance and critical applications.
 * <p> Using non-heap storage options <em>Chronicle</em> provides a processing environment where
 * applications does not suffer from <em>GarbageCollection</em>. <em>GarbageCollection</em> (GC) may
 * slow down your critical operations non-deterministically at any time.. In order to avoid
 * non-determinism and escape from GC delays off-heap memory solutions are addressed. The main idea
 * is to manage your memory manually so does not suffer from GC. Chronicle behaves like a management
 * interface over off-heap memory so you can build your own solutions over it.
 * <p><em>Chronicle</em> uses RandomAccessFiles while managing memory and this choice brings lots of
 * possibility. Random access files permit non-sequential, or random, access to a file's contents.
 * To access a file randomly, you open the file, seek a particular location, and read from or
 * writeBytes to that file. RandomAccessFiles can be seen as "large" C-type byte arrays that you can
 * access any random index "directly" using pointers. File portions can be used as ByteBuffers if
 * the portion is mapped into memory.
 * <p>{@link ChronicleQueue} (now in the specific sense) is the main interface for management and
 * can be seen as the "Collection class" of the <em>Chronicle</em> environment. You will reserve a
 * portion of memory and then put/fetch/update records using the {@link ChronicleQueue}
 * interface.</p>
 * <p>{@link ExcerptCommon} is the main data container in a {@link ChronicleQueue}, each Chronicle
 * is composed of Excerpts. Putting data to a queue means starting a new Excerpt, writing data into
 * it and finishing the Excerpt at the upper.</p>
 * <p>While {@link ExcerptCommon} is a generic purpose container allowing for remote access, it also
 * has more specialized counterparts for sequential operations. See {@link ExcerptTailer} and {@link
 * ExcerptAppender}</p>
